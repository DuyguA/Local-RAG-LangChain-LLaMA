# RAG with LangChain and Local LLaMa Model


Welcome to the repo of the tutorial "Multimodal RAG with LangChain and Local LLaVa Model". This repo contains code and helper data of the Youtube video tutorial VIDEO BURAYA, third video of the series "Practical RAG with LangChain under 15 Minutes."


If you wanna work on the Colan notebook directly, please navigate to:

and make your own copy of the notebook. You can also find the notebook in the repo.
The requirements are installed in the first few lines of the notebook.

You can access first video and second video on their Github repos and Youtube videos as well.
